# Hey! I'm Luis ðŸ‘‹

**Software Engineer**

Currently I will be focusing on training my skills without any assistance from LLMs.

Anything that I will upload to GitHub will be 100% built by myself + research on google/stackoverflow.

I don't think using LLMs is a bad thing but in my learning route I decided to never use them.
